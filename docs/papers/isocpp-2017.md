# Context

Round-off errors propagation is a primary concern in numerical
simulations. However, only a few tools exists to identify, analyse,
debug and correct portion of the code causing numerical instabilities
to appear and propagate.

`CADNA`, developed by the Computer Science Laboratory of the PARIS 6
university is a library aiming solving the previous issues. With
`CADNA` the numerical quality of any simulation program can be
controlled. By detecting all the instabilities which may occur at run
time, a numerical debugging of the user code can be performed. Another
feature (but not the least) provided by `CADNA` is that data errors
can be taken into account for the estimation of the final
accuracy. Based on the latter, this paper will also advocate another
potential usage of `CADNA`: building unit tests assessing that
numerical algorithms remains stable as their implementation evolves
(whatever the reason).

The aim of this article is to present an implementation of the `CADNA`
library based on modern C++ (C++11), to present our design choices to
make the numerical types introduced by the library as closed as
possible than plain old floatting point numbers.

## A introductory example

To have an overview of the library, consider the following example
which evaluates the function
\(f\left(x,y\right)=9\,x^{4}-y^{4}+2\,y^{2}\) for the \(10864,18817\)
and \(1/3,2/3\):

~~~~{.cpp}
#include <iostream>
#include"cadna/numeric_type.hxx"

using real = cadna::numeric_type<double>;

real rump(const real x,const real y){
  const real a = 9*x*x*x*x;
  const real b = y*y*y*y;
  const real c = 2*y*y;
  return a-b+c;
};

int main(void){
  real x = 10864;
  real y = 18817;
  std::cout << "f: " << rump(x,y) << std::endl;
  x = 1/real(3);
  y = 2/real(3);
  std::cout << "f: " << rump(x,y) << std::endl;
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
~~~~

The output of the simple test is the following:

~~~~{.sh}
----------------------------------------------------------------
CADNA software --- University P. et M. Curie --- LIP6
----------------------------------------------------------------
f:  @.0
f:  0.802469135802469E+000
----------------------------------------------------------------
CADNA software --- University P. et M. Curie --- LIP6
There are 2 numerical instabilities
2 LOSS(ES) OF ACCURACY DUE TO CANCELLATION(S)
----------------------------------------------------------------
~~~~

This example shows that the numerical types introduced by the `CADNA`
library are meant to be drop-in replacement of plain old floating
point types. **Using `CADNA` shall be a simple a replacing every
floating point type by their `CADNA` counterparts, recompiling and
linking against the `cadna_cxx` shared library.**

The first output states that the result computed is pure numerical
noise (`@.0`).

By setting a break point at the `cadna::instability` function, one may
analyse the cause of the numerical instability in the debugger.

One may also use the `unwind` library (or one of its native
equivalent), to display at runtime. To do this, one have to include
the `cadna/logstream.hxx` header and append the following line at the
beginning of `main`:

~~~~{.cpp}
int main(void){
  cadna::add_logstream(std::cout);
~~~~

The output is now as follows:

~~~~{.sh}

The fourth line from the line tells us that the function triggering
the instability is: `_Z4rumpN5cadna12numeric_typeIdEES1_`. After some
demangling (using `c++filt` under `LiNuX`), this appears to be the
`rump` function.

The library can be instrumented in numerous ways using the
`cadna::add_instability_handler` which takes a `std::function` object
as argument.

# The theoretical foundations of the `CADNA` library: probabilistic arithmetics based on the `CESTAC` approach

Basically, `CADNA` replaces the standard floating point number by
so-called stocastic types. Internally, those type contain \(N\)
floating point numbers which all represents an approximation of the
result. Each floatting point operations is repeated \(N\) with a
random bias. If the \(N\) numbers representing the final result are
closed from each others, this result is very accurate. If those number
differ significantly, this result is unreliable. The comparison of
those numbers also provide an estimation of the number of significant
digits in the final result. Moreover, by instrumenting every floating
point operation, one can identify the ones responsible for significant
accuracy loss. In practice, \(N\) is taken egal to \(3\).

# The driving reason for this new implementation

## Removing code generation based on `m4` macros

First versions of `CADNA` were written in `Fortran` and targeted this
language, the `de facto` standard in numerical simulations at that
time.

To provide a drop-in replacement of native types, one had to implement:

- All the possible numerical operations between two `CADNA` floating
  point objects, and all the operations between one `CADNA` floating
  point object and all the native ones (including integers).
- All the overloads of the standard math library functions (`cos`,
  `exp`, etc.).

As `Fortran` lacks supports for templates, the `CADNA` developers
recoursed to `m4` macros to generate those operations. For maintenance
and portability, replacing `m4` macros by template functions and
operators is a clear gain for a modern `C++` implementation of this
library.

This strategy has been reused the create the "`C`" version of `CADNA`
described below.

## Better support of `C++`

The "`C`" version was indeed based on `C++` to provide its numeric
types, leveraging the compatibility of `C` and `C++` to allow most `C`
code to be modified.

However, this `C` version was not meant for software heavily relying
on the `C++` standard:

- It provided overload for the mathematical function declared the
  `math.h` header, but no overload their counterparts defined in the
  `::std` namespace.
- It did not provide appropriate overload of several usefull traits
  classes defined is the standard, such as `std::numeric_limits`,
  `std::is_floating_point`, `std::is_scalar`, etc.

The `C++` standard extensively protects the `::std` namespace in C++11
17.6.4.2.1, but specifically allows the overloading of traits classes
in paragraphs 1 and 2:

> The behavior of a C++ program is undefined if it adds declarations
> or definitions to namespace `std` or to a namespace within namespace
> `std` unless otherwise specified. A program may add a template
> specialization for any standard library template to namespace std
> only if the declaration depends on a user-defined type and the
> specialization meets the standard library requirements for the
> original template and is not explicitly prohibited.
> 
> [...] A program may explicitly instantiate a template defined in the
> standard library only if the declaration depends on the name of a
> user-defined type and the instantiation meets the standard library
> requirements for the original template.

Overloading functions in the `std` namespace is not legal and we rely
on Argument Dependent Lookup to declare our implementations in a
dedicated namespace.

However, in some cases, it is mandatory to also overload the standard
mathematical functions, as some users may fully qualify the
mathematical functions in their libraries. Indeed fully-qualifying
mathematical functions can be considered a good practice as it
prevents dumb mistakes, such as unattended casts. Consider the case of
the `abs` functions which is defined in both `cstdlib` and `cmath`
headers. If one forgets to include the `cmath` header and do not
qualify the `abs` function, the `abs` function argument will be casted
to integers, leading to a subtle bug.

## Better portability

We choose to rely on the `cmake` build system for maximal portability.

Our implementation works with the following compilers:

- GNU compiler
- Intel compiler
- Clang compiler
- Microsoft Visual Studio compiler

## Support extended precision numbers

Aside the `fortran` and `C` versions of `CADNA`, a library called
`SAM` (Stochastic Arithmetic in Multiprecision) has been created to
support arbitrary multiprecision numbers, as introduced by the `MPFR`
libray.

The `Boost Multiprecision` library provides integer, rational and
floating-point types in C++ that have more range and precision than
C++'s ordinary built-in types.

Combining the `Boost Multiprecision`library and our implementation is
straight-forward by providing an appropriate specialization of the
`cadna::default_accuracy` traits class.

This approach has one intrinsic limit: contrary to `SAM`, the accurary
of the extended floating-point types is fixed a compile-time.

## Support for `python` and `fortran` bindings

Our implementation support `python` and `fortran` bindings.

# Implementations details

# Missing features and future works

## `constexpr` variables

By nature, `constexpr` expressions are meant to be evaluated at
compile-time. This feature does not mix well with the stochastic
nature of the operation on `CADNA` floating point types.
